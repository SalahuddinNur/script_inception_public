Bristol FDTD notes:
====================

entry order matters:
--------------------

When using .in files, the order of objects must be as follows:

-"input objects" (anything, except mesh): flag, boundaries, excitations, probes, etc
-mesh
-"geometric objects" (anything, except box): blocks, cylinders, etc
-box

end statements:
---------------
Adding an "end" statement in a BFDTD input file causes bfdtd to stop reading the rest of the file.

But "end" is not required in input files!
If missing, BFDFD will just read until the end of the file.

example:
~~~~~~~~
  probe
  {
  ...
  }

  probe
  {
  ...
  }

  end ** this line causes bfdtd to stop reading the rest of this file!

  probe
  {
  ...
  }

  probe
  {
  ...
  }
